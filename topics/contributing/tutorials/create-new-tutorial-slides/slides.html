# Slides

- Introduce a subject
- Quick overview
- Not too much text
- Images are Nice

---



## Formatting: Basic

```markdown
### Slide Title

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.com/) and an image:

![Description of the image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
---
```

Will be rendered as...

???
It's standard markdown. There is less need to follow semantic heading guidelines (not skipping levels).
